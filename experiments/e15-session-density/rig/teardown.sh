# experiments/e15-session-density/rig/teardown.sh [--purge] -- undo setup.sh (SPEC §4).
#
# Replays, in reverse order, every "| UNDO: <cmd>" line the manifest (~/e15-manifest.md, or
# E15_MANIFEST) recorded since its last "## Teardown" section, then appends a Teardown section
# naming each command replayed and its exit code. With --purge it then replays the "| PURGE:" lines
# (E15's built artifacts and /srv/e15 itself) in reverse, after the UNDO lines.
#
# A failing undo is reported and the rest still run; the exit code is 1 if any failed.
# Afterwards (unless E15_TEARDOWN_VERIFY=0) it checks the host is as E15 found it:
# microvm-worker.service active, bench-cp and bench-redis running, nothing E15's on its ports.
#
# fresh-metal (lib.sh E15_HOST_PROFILE, recorded by setup/bootstrap in /srv/e15/state): no host
# worker or bench containers to verify. A plain teardown stops E15's services and removes its unit
# files; --purge then also undoes bootstrap.sh (the kvm group membership) and removes /srv/e15
# (toolchain, Firecracker, podman storage, every artifact), leaving the OS as found apart from the
# manifest's LEFTOVER lines (apt packages E15 installed, kept), which it lists at the end. When
# /srv/e15 is the data volume's mount point its contents go, then bootstrap's PURGE lines umount
# it, drop its fstab line and remove the mount point; the volume itself is never wiped. A mount
# with no such lines (mounted by the operator) is left as an empty mount point, and verify accepts it.
